### Project Summary

This project focuses on understanding the OSI model and various networking concepts. Below is a summary of the tasks and their objectives:

#### 0. OSI Model
- **Description**: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract framework that describes layered communication and network design. It segregates different parts of communication into layers, from physical transmission (Layer 1) to application-specific communication (Layer 7).
- **Focus Areas**: Transport layer (TCP/UDP), Network layer (IP and ICMP).
- **Questions**:
  - What is the OSI model?
  - How is the OSI model organized?
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `0-OSI_model`

#### 1. Types of Network
- **Description**: Understanding different types of networks such as LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet.
- **Questions**:
  - What type of network is a local computer connected to?
  - What type of network connects offices in different buildings?
  - What network is used when browsing the internet on a smartphone?
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `1-types_of_network`

#### 2. MAC and IP Address
- **Description**: Understanding the difference between MAC and IP addresses.
- **Questions**:
  - What is a MAC address?
  - What is an IP address?
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `2-MAC_and_IP_address`

#### 3. UDP and TCP
- **Description**: Comparing UDP and TCP protocols.
- **Questions**:
  - Which statements correctly describe TCP and UDP?
  - What does a TCP worker typically ask?
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `3-UDP_and_TCP`

#### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
- **Description**: Understanding TCP and UDP ports and their significance.
- **Task**: Write a Bash script to display listening ports, showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`

#### 5. Is the Host on the Network
- **Description**: Using ICMP to check if a network device is available.
- **Task**: Write a Bash script to ping an IP address passed as an argument.
- **Repository**:
  - GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-network`
  - Directory: `basics_0`
  - File: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network`
